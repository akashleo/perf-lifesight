⚠️ IMPORTANT: Before running the app, please follow these steps:

1. Create a 'public' folder in the root directory:
   mkdir public

2. Move the data file into the public folder:
   move "1. marketing_dashboard_data.json" public/

3. Install dependencies:
   npm install

4. Start the development server:
   npm run dev

The data file MUST be in the public/ directory for the app to load it correctly.

After moving the file, your structure should look like:
perf-lifesight/
├── public/
│   └── 1. marketing_dashboard_data.json  ← Data file here
├── src/
├── package.json
└── ... other files

See SETUP.md for detailed instructions.
